        Religious tourism plays a significant role in the state's economy. Varanasi is a major religious hub and one of
        the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism and Jainism. Vrindavan is considered to be a holy place for
        Vaishnavism.Sravasti generally considered as revered sites in Buddhism, believed to be where the Buddha taught
        many of his Suttas (sermons). Owing to the belief as to the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadh) has been
        regarded as one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites. Millions gather at Prayagraj to take part in the
        Magh Mela festival on the banks of the Ganges. This festival is organised on a larger scale every 12th year and
        is called the Kumbh Mela, where over 10 million Hindu pilgrims congregate in one of the largest gatherings of
        people in the world.</p>
